- Personalize with colors, fonts, styling.

For this project, I decided to create a webpage for the Loporrit cafe introduced within the Loporrit beast tribe during FFXIV: Endwalker.

## [What Went Right]

Obtaining the content for this project was fairly straightforward. I was able to use in-game footage to create a splash image and obtain a product showcase. I also reviewed the website of a local pub that I often visit for their amazing Sunday lunch to get an idea of styling. This influence is particularly reflected in the footer, where I tried to replicate the same layout as their page.

The responsiveness of this page was a fun challenge. To meet project requirements, I used properties including `column-reverse` and `order`. For example, for the About Section, without the `column-reverse` on mobile, it would have resulted in the splash image and the about us images being on top of each other and causing the user to have to scroll to get to more content. Not the best experience for them.

## [What Went Wrong]

I had trouble deciding on a color scheme for this project. It changed several times. I uploaded the splash image to [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) for it to generate a theme, but the colors it suggested were difficult to work with from a contrast perspective. The theme I came up with ultimately ignored those suggestions - the dark background was never suggested but I feel it fits the theme of a space cafe. And the purple sort of matches with colors of the images without being exact.

## [Lessons Learned]

One key thing I learned was how I can change the default `rem` using the `html` selector. By using a font size of 62.5%, it meant that I was able to work with the 10 times table versus 16. While I do not want to be dependent on that forever as a beginner in coding, it was helpful to be able to review my code and know instantly what the `rem` worked out to in pixels.

The project also gave me a grasp of how to choose a color scheme, given the challenges I had finding a theme for this project.

## [Future Improvements]

It may be fun, once I have progressed further with my course, to return to this project to add a contact us form for people wanting to book a table at the cafe.
